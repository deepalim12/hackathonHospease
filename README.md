# Hospease - Smart Hospital Management System

Hospease is an innovative web-based solution aimed at streamlining hospital operations, enhancing patient experience, and enabling real-time collaboration between patients, doctors, and administration. Built during a hackathon, our platform focuses on automating and optimizing hospital workflows.
We got the inspiration from the real life difficulties, we faced in finding good hospitals, when we moved to patna for our college.
